# Files to backup

## Public backup

My public config files are in this github repo, and locally stored in 

### ~/
- [TODO] ~/.ssh/config



### /etc/
- [TODO] /etc/ssh/ssh_config

## Private backup

Those are the files I backup, that you know of, but that aren't backed up unencrypted to public clouds.

My entire $HOME folder is backed up encrypt, alongside my /etc for every machine.
