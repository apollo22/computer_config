# Shells configuration

## Configuration files

Shells specific files remains in the location where they are defined, however, they try to load common files, namely:
  - **shellsrc**, in **~/.config/shells/shellsrc** from ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc

For common aliases, **shellsrc** loads the file **~/.config/shells/shells_aliases**.

## Aliases

Aliases are defined in many files, depending on the shell used :
  - **~/.config/shells/shells_aliases** for aliases used by all shells
  - **~/.config/shells/<shell_name>_aliases** for aliases used by a specific shell
  - **~/.config/shells/documents_aliases/public** for aliases used to navigate to directories and edit files I share with everyone on Internet
  - **~/.config/shells/documents_aliases/private** for aliases used to navigate to directories and edit files that are privates
  - **~/.config/shells/documents_aliases/<project_name>** for aliases used to navigate to directories and edit files that are bound to projects
