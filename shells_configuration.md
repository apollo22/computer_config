## Configuration files

Shells specific files remains in the location where they are defined, however, they try to load common files, namely:
  - shellsrc, in **~/.config/shells/shellsrc** from ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc

For common aliases, 'shellsrc' loads the file **~/.config/shells/shells_aliases**.
