# RSS Agregator

I want to open my links in the external browser
I would like the Window Manager to open my RSS Agregator next to my Web browser so that any link opened is opened in the browser window next to my RSS Agregator window.
I don't want to see articles I already read, but I want to see all the sources

## General Shortcut
Next      Article : k ; Down Arrow 
Previous  Article : l ; Up Arrow
Next      Folder  : ; ; Right Arrow
Previous  Folder  : j ; Left Arrow 
Open link in browser : Enter

## Akgregator
Need to remap shortcuts
