## OpenSSH

### SSH Client Configuration

To understand OpenSSH ssh client configuration files, check ```man ssh_config```

The following files are my ssh client configuration files :

-  **~/.ssh/config**: this file only points to ~/.config/ssh/config, so that when OpenSSH will support 'XDG Base Directory Specification', I will only have to delete it.
- **~/.config/ssh/config** 


### SSH Server Configuration
