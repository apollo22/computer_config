## Manage i3 workspace

I use the following python script to rename, move to and move windows across workspaces.

https://github.com/cameronleger/i3-workspacer

To use it, install python i3ipc module using.
```
# pip install i3ipc
```

Then, copy the python script in your i3 config folder and modify your i3 configuration to use it.

## Logout, suspend, hibernate, reboot and poweroff
I use systemctl commands and i3-lock

## Shortcuts
$mod + z --> workspace mode (more shortcuts for each workspace)
$mod + ?x? --> last urgent workspace-window

# Other
I use i3-dmenu-desktop instead of dmenu-run

# Move between named workspaces

## Specific software configuration
### Thunderbird
In i3, thunderbird windows are not correctly detected for floating mode, so I add the following (current config is in the dot files):
```
## Thunderbird windows
### Events dialog
for_window [window_role="EventDialog"] floating enable
### Confirm Exit Window: todo, add always on top
for_window [window_role="confirmEx"] floating enable
### Message compose window
for_window [window_role="Msgcompose"] floating enable
```
